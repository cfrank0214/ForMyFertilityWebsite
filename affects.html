            <p class="card-text">A woman’s fertility starts to gradually decline around age 27 and drops off
              dramatically after age 35. Women in their twenties have a 20 to 25 percent chance of pregnancy each
              month. At 30, the chance of becoming pregnant in a given month drops to around 15 percent and by 35, the
              likelihood is less than 10 percent in a given month. A woman is born with all of the eggs she will ever
              have so as she ages, she has fewer eggs and the percentage of genetically normal eggs declines. Women in
              their twenties have greater pregnancy odds since they have more eggs and a higher ratio of genetically
              normal eggs.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Ovulation is when a mature egg is released from the ovary. The egg then moves down the fallopian
                  tube where it can be fertilized. If sperm are in the fallopian tube when the egg is released, there
                  is a good chance that the egg will be fertilized, creating an embryo, which can grow into a baby.</li>
                <li>Pregnancy is technically only possible if you have sex during the five days before ovulation or on
                  the day of ovulation. But the most fertile days are the three days leading up to and including
                  ovulation. Having sex during this time gives you the best chance of getting pregnant.</li>
                <li>By 12-24 hours after ovulation, a woman is no longer able to get pregnant during that menstrual
                  cycle because the egg is no longer in the fallopian tube.</li>
                <li>There’s almost no chance of getting pregnant if you have sex before or after the fertile window
                  (but if you’re not trying to get pregnant, don’t rely on this – contraception is your best option!).</li>

            <p class="card-text">Twelve percent of all infertility can be linked to weighing too much or too little.
              What is the ideal weight for optimal fertility? The ideal BMI is between 20 and 22. Women who are
              overweight or obese (BMI of higher than 25, and higher than 30, respectively) are at an increased risk
              for infertility due to anovulation. Even women who are at the higher end of the normal BMI range tend to
              have a slightly higher risk of infertility. On the other hand being too lean can also lead to lack of
              ovulation and infertility.
              <ul>
                <li>BMI: One way to measure whether you're in a healthy weight range is using the Body Mass Index or
                  BMI. You can enter your height and weight into this BMI calculator to find out your BMI number.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered a ‘healthy weight’.</li>
                  <li>A BMI below 18.5 is considered ‘underweight’.</li>
                  <li>A BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered ‘overweight’.</li>
                  <li>A BMI over 30 is considered ‘obese’.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>A severely underweight woman (with less than 17 percent body fat) may have irregular ovulation,
                  reducing their odds of conception. This is most common in women who are athletes or have an eating
                  disorder. Maintaining a healthy BMI will help you achieve your optimal fertility</li>
