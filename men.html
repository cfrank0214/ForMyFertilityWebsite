        <h2 class="call-acton">Infertility in men most caused by:</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>A problem called varicocele (VAIR-ih-koh-seel). This happens when the veins on a man's testicle(s) are
              too large. This heats the testicles. The heat can affect the number or shape of the sperm.</li>
            <li>Other factors that cause a man to make too few sperm or none at all.</li>
            <li>Movement of the sperm. This may be caused by the shape of the sperm. Sometimes injuries or other damage
              to the reproductive system block the sperm.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Sometimes a man is born with the problems that affect his sperm. Other times problems start later in life
          due to illness or injury. For example, cystic fibrosis often causes infertility in men.
          <ul>
            <li>Sperm count is dynamic- you can affect your sperm count in less than 90 days. Take the quiz- (use the
              quiz on Trak- how do you want to do this so we get the answers too…)</li>
            <li>Test your sperm count- privately ( Trak info- product- sales. Need to discuss how we want to integrate)</li>

            <p class="card-text">
              <ul>
                <li>The chance of having a child is much higher for women younger than 35 years and men younger than 40
                  years than for older women and men.</li>
                <li>Younger men have more active and better-quality sperm than older men. Most men make millions of new
                  sperm every day, but men older than 40 have fewer healthy sperm than younger men.</li>
                <li>The amount of semen (the fluid that contains sperm) and sperm motility (ability to move towards an
                  egg) decrease continually between the ages of 20 and 80.</li>

            <p class="card-text">
              <ul>
                <li>There is no safe limit for smoking, the only way to protect yourself and your unborn baby from harm
                  is to quit. ***The chemicals in cigarettes damage eggs and sperm, and can affect a baby’s health.***</li>
                <li>Men and women who smoke take longer to get pregnant than non-smokers. Second-hand smoke is almost
                  as damaging as smoking and women who are exposed to second-hand smoke take longer to conceive than
                  women who are not. The chemicals in cigarettes can cause damage to eggs and sperm which affects a
                  future child's health. Smoking affects every stage of the reproduction process – in both men and
                  women.</li>

            <p class="card-text">Men who are overweight or obese have worse sperm quality and are not as fertile as men
              who are a healthy weight. Being overweight or obese can cause hormonal changes that reduce fertility and
              make men less interested in sex. Men who are very overweight are also more likely to have problems
              getting and keeping an erection. Together, these factors reduce the chances of fathering a child.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common. People who have an STI often have
              no symptoms and can therefore have the infection for some time without being diagnosed or treated. STIs
              like chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and mycoplasma genitalium can cause fertility problems. ***Some

            <h4 class="card-title">Heat</h4>
            <p class="card-text">Keep your testes cool if you want to be a father in the future. Testes need to be a
              few degrees cooler than the rest of the body to make good quality sperm. This is why they sit in the
              scrotum which acts like an ‘evaporative air conditioning system’, at a lower temperature than the rest of
              the body. If it gets too hot around the testes, they can have problems making sperm. Testes will start
              producing sperm again once the temperature of the scrotum stays at its normal lower level, which might
              take a few months.</p>

              improve your bone health and your general health. Using anabolic steroids to increase muscle mass stops
              the production of sperm and may have other serious side effects.</p>
